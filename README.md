Max Box Layers on Pallets 

Overview

The EHS AI-Based Pallet Stacking and Transportation System is an advanced solution aimed at enhancing safety and efficiency in logistics and production environments.

This system utilizes cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies to ensure that pallets are stacked with a maximum of five layers of boxes, preventing overloading and ensuring safe transportation from the warehouse to the production area.

Objective

Enhance Safety: Prevent overloading of pallets to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries during transportation.

Compliance: Ensure adherence to safety regulations and standards related to pallet stacking and transportation.

Key Components

Data Collection and Annotation

Collect a comprehensive dataset of images and videos from warehouse environments. (In place, but can be enhanced by students.)

Annotate the dataset to label various objects such as boxes and pallets. (In place, but can be enhanced by students.)
